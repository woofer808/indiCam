// Currently doing:



/* Changelog version 1.31*/	
///		PRIORITIES / DONE
//ADDED- Names of players now show in GUI map.
//FIXED- Manual mode camera no longer resets after scene timer runs out or camera gets too far away from actor or actor gets hidden.
//ADDED- Added CBA keybinds for when CBA is loaded. Without CBA, the legacy keypresses are used.
//FIXED- Manual camera now targets the actual actor, not any proxy objects.
//REMOVED- Neither script nor mod version gives the cameraman an addaction anymore. Use default F1 or set your own key
//ADDED- Added a centralized debug system. Replacement of old system in code will be ongoing.
//ADDED- Various new scenes to each of the vehicle types.
//ADDED- New scenetype "stationaryCameraAbsoluteZ" for absolute altitude instead of relative to actor.
//FIXED- Switching actor will now reset the automatic actor switch timer
//FIXED- Some slight code optimization
//FIXED- Zero divisor math error in a helicopter scene fixed. Thanks to Damien!
//FIXED- Scene followTight is now used for infantry at action value 1. Thanks to VileAce!
//FIXED- Automatic switching of random unit within distance from current actor always picked the current actor. Thanks to VileAce!
//FIXED- removeAllEventHandlers was causing issues with other mods running in special scene atGuy - code fix by VileAce!
//FIXED- Removed some comments used with the comment=""-command (Thanks to Brett)



//TODO- Move keybinds from init to control script. Only F1 should work when camera is not running.
//TODO- Make it so that the script can be started without the GUI stuff. vision index currently craps it up. check TETET's post. --> Thanks for this not so informative comment, past me.

//TODO- Possibility to state conditions in a scene to disqualify it. For example if a scene should only be used for a specific vehicle.
//TODO- When a player actor enters a vehicle, the camera autoswitches actor according to current settings instead of staying with the unit.
//TODO- Make sure the camera keeps following actors after death.
//TODO- Add "persistent actor" function if that's not already in by default by selecting "none" in randomizer. It would then need something else to do while respawning and come back to the same player unit after respawn.
//TODO- Would be totally cool with a flashlight type function as with Zeus or the editor. Maybe spawn a local light above the actor?
//TODO- Preventing scene switching doesn't seem to prevent scene switching by obscured actor. Are we fine with that?

///		SCRIPTED SCENES 
//TODO- How do the new special scene actor stuff work alongside unconcious units with ace or reggs script?
//TODO- Add "killer" as scripted scene as a death scene. Could be made to be shown on every occation in GUI.
//TODO- Detect incoming mortar fire and switch to show an overview of the location at impact
//TODO- Soemthing weird with launcherScan sometimes. It's like it's being looped endlessly on having an AT actor on cooldown
//TODO- When the AT script is activated, it should keep a lookout if the unit puts the AT back.
//TODO- Scripted scene: DropOff - Keep track of helicopters when they have low velocity < 70 and are close to ground (< 10m) and in camera vincinity

///		BACKLOG
//TODO- Fog of war functionality. A checkbox in the GUI that only shows enemies that current camera side knowsAbout.
//TODO- Might need to spawn a background function that keeps track of indiCam_running variable
//TODO- Scripted scenes that makes jumps to close-by animals
//TODO- Make a scene switch if the camera is stuck to the ground for too long
//TODO- Add proximity to enemies as a way to elevate the action value in situation check
//TODO- Moving value should maybe be used to stay on at least action value 1 in situation check
//TODO- Maybe should spawn several different action system checks that can work independently in situation check
//TODO- When using the randomize actor starting out from a civilian actor, the result might be an agent
//TODO- Add a good looking text that pops up on screen for a short time each time the actor was changed. gui: ["OFF", "TEMPORARY", "PERMANENT"]
//TODO- Player selection list in dialogControl might need a refresh button. Now the user has to restart the dialog entirely.
//TODO- Make indiCam_fnc_distanceSort function test if proper params were passed.
//TODO- Add cleanup script that waits for the camera to close. Should make for a more stable cleanup if the main scripts gets interrupted
//TODO- Check to see if we can detect weapon switching. That would help with camera views on vehicles (compare current ammo to weapon type?)
//TODO- Rewrite game logics according to the new method used in randomLinear ro remove dependency on the logic objects.
//TODO- Make vehicles and aircraft detect shooting scenes with either a single fire category or by actionLevel
//TODO- Now that I have the environmentCheck I may want to add disqualification with something like (_urbanBool) then {find a new scene};
//TODO- Add indiCam_var_proximityValue functionality to situationCheck
//TODO- Add indiCam_var_movingValue functionality to situationCheck
//TODO- New scene: One that starts away from the actor and then uses cameraLogic to reduce distance in a non-linear manner
//TODO- New scene: groundCam - Human perspective of aircraft going by. Camera stationary at 1.8m
//TODO- New scene: randomWideFar - Randomized, long range, stationary shots with wide fov.
//TODO- New scene: weaponPerson - This would be the weaponCam, I guess. I'd love to get this to work
//TODO- New scene: linearPanCam - Camera that pans linearly while targeting the infrontLogic
//TODO- New scene: curvePanCam - Camera that pans non-linearly while targeting the infrontLogic
//TODO- New scene: groupCam - A camera that takes an entire squad into shot. Maybe maxDistance can be used to keep it in line if one member is half a world away. Check worldToScreen.
//TODO- New scene: Weapon cam tank/helo - attached right above or below the vic and rotating along with main barrel
//TODO- New scene: Infront logic combined with a camera attached above the rear of a tank


//OPINION- Tankbuster: fixed-wing, a camera 'bolted' to the top of the tailplane looking forward, or close to a weapon pylon. Perhaps it could switch near pylon/gun when player changes fire mode?
//OPINION- Land vehicles, when the player is in a Prowler, for example, a camera bolted to the roll cage would be funky.


//IDEA- "Roving mode" that doesn't make cuts, but simply moves the camera.
//IDEA- A more obvious indicator for when the camera is running. Perhaps a color indicator?
//IDEA- Make indiCam automatically look for other players on the server at startup and set one as actor. If no other players are there, set player as actor.
//IDEA- Add to GUI: indiCam_var_hiddenActorTime = 4; // Seconds to allow the actor to be hidden before switching scene unless indiCam_var_ignoreHiddenActor is true
//IDEA- Investigate "createSimpleObject/objects" if it's something that's better to use for logics
//IDEA- Maybe build a "transition" part between scenes, so that each scene can define how to go into it - sort of like with the different camera commits
//IDEA- A follow logic that tracks exactly where the actor stepped. That way it can follow through doors
//IDEA- Let advanced users override the onboard sceneSelect for a userconfig version.
//IDEA- Add ability to suspend the automatic switching of scenes at least through script. Would not top LOS switching.
//IDEA- Keep track of actor taking damage, up the action when that happens
//IDEA- Add camera control for other players. Maybe by broadcasting a variable containing connection ID or having a user grab the cameraman ID.
//IDEA- Add the possibility for the camera to follow objects around that has object name starting with indiCam_baton* in it's inventory
//IDEA- Maybe I should convert the main loop's interrupt to a function that I can call wherever?
//IDEA- Let any player walk up to the cameraman and action menu himself a set of addactions controls. that way we can send the vars to the correct connection id.
//IDEA- Is it possible to keep the follow logics away from buildings? Would help with LOS stuff
//IDEA- Maybe add a counter to sceneSelect so that the next scene test only tries a set number of times before waiting a little while before trying again.
//IDEA- How to stream the camera input to only an HUD element? Problem is camera commit. Maybe if the camera is created but not started it will work just fine? See KK's blog.
//IDEA- Can I get the camera to switch to first person view? Like when in a vic. Problem is recording will contain same perspective at times.
//IDEA- I need a way to know if an actor is on screen. some scenes are badly trimmed in. Maybe use worldToScreen?
//IDEA- A scene that checks for building windows around the actor and attempts to look through from the inside.
//IDEA- Maybe use something like {_justPlayers = allPlayers - entities "HeadlessClient_F";} to find players instead of what's used now
